      <br>
      Hi there! <br> My name’s David and I’m a software developer based in Portugal, and this is my little
    corner here on the Internet.
      <br><br>
    I use this page both to share my professional experience as a programmer, but also as a small playground to
    showcase some things that I'm interested in. Right now I'm curious about 3D and WebGL.
      <br><br>
    I invite you to take a look at what I've been working on, and feel free to shoot me an email or get in contact through any of my socials that I
    have linked here.
    Take care!
      <br><br><br>
