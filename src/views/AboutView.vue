    My name’s David and I’m a software developer based in Portugal.

I’m reaching out to you to hopefully start a new connection, and to present to you my desire to work for your company. At the moment I’m looking for new job opportunities. Particularly working for roles using Python, in any role, or in a Full Stack position like I am now, with a bigger emphasis on backend. I won’t shy away from challenges to learn different programming languages or work in different frameworks either.
